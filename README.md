# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 🦀
My solutions to the edition of the year 2025 of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) calendar of programming puzzles.

## How to Use
Feel free to run this code by yourself. Inputs goes on the `input` folder (be sure their names ends in `.txt`). Given you have [Rust Tools](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) installed and set up, just run the following command to run all days in sequence
```sh
cargo run --release
```
Or, if you rather, run specfic days by replacing the `XX` on the following command
```sh
cargo run --bin XX --release
```
